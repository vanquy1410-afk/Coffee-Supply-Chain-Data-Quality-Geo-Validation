# Coffee-Supply-Chain-Data-Quality-Geo-Validation

## Overview
This project focuses on data cleaning, consistency validation, and geographic verification of coffee origin and shipment data using Excel, and GIS-based validation techniques.

The project focuses on:
- Data cleaning & consistency
- Data validation & completeness
- Structured data compilation
- Compliance-oriented reporting

The dataset structure and data issues are designed to closely resemble
**real-world regulatory and sourcing challenges** in the coffee supply chain.

## Data Cleaning & Validation Scope
- Handling missing values (blank → "Unknown")
- Country–Continent consistency checks
- ID relationship validation (Farmer ID vs Shipment ID)
- Date and year standardization
- Categorical value normalization

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel (PivotTable, Power Query, validation formulas)
- CSV / XLS structured datasets
- GIS data concepts (location consistency)
